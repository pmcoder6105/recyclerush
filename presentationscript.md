## Presentation Script for Recycle Rush

### Introduction:

Welcome judges, my name is Pratyush Mahadevaiah, and I'm excited to share our new video game, Recycle Rush, that teaches players the importance of sorting waste correctly while making it engaging and memorable.

### Inspiration:

My inpsiration for Recycle Rush came from the growing problem of improper waste disposal and its impact on our environment. Many people struggle to distinguish between recyclable, compostable, and trash items. We wanted to create a solution that's both educational and entertaining, helping people build better habits.

### How it works:

Recycle Rush is a drag-and-drop game where players sort moving items into the correct bins: recycling, compost, or trash. Each level gets faster, introducing more challenging items like soda cans and apple cores. For every correct match, you earn points; for every mistake, you lose a life. It's simple to play but challenging to master.

### Educational value:

What makes Recycle Rush unique is its focus on education. For example, if you miscategorize an item, the game pauses and presents a screen to explain why it belongs in a specific bin. This in turn creates a learning opportunity and encourages players to be more mindful of their waste sorting in real life.

### Technical Features

Recycle Rush was built using Unity. The game features dynamic animations, interactive sound effects, and progressively challenging levels. It also tracks your scores and provides tips for improving your sorting skills.

### Impact and Goals:

Our ultimate goal is to raise awareness about waste sorting and make recycling habits second nature. Whether you're a student, a professional, or just someone looking for a fun game, Recycling Rush turns an everyday responsibility into an exciting game. Thank you for letting me share Recyclign Rush with you. I hope this game inspires players to take small but meaningful steps towards a more sustainable future.
